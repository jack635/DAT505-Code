# Final Project
In my final assignment, I tried to create an immersive space, but due to limited technology, it may not achieve the desired effect. After overcoming many difficulties, I finally finished my work.For my final project, I used a first-person view, where you can mouse through the entire scene. I used the water and sky box to show the big atmosphere, and added a little fog effect. Then the ship model is imported and generated at random positions and angles. Two pieces of background music were added as an aid
